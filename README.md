# Module 3 Challenge

This project was designed for us to create a random password generator with prompts for 
a user to choose how many characters they'd like the password to be as well as the 
inclusion of lower-case/upper-case letters, numbers and special characters. 

I was able to accomplish this by:
    -Creating arrays for each confirm
    -Creating a function for the prompts/random characters
    -Creating a global variable of "options" and finding a way for the variable "userInput"
    to be used in different functions

This was a difficult task for me at first, I had trouble with figuring out where to start,
however, after I was done with the psuedocode, it made more sense to me and I began to connect
the dots. The task asked a lot more of me when it came to JavaScript and I learned a lot throughout
the project to the point where JavaScript flows for me a lot more now.
